This file contains some HowTo's...

Basic Howto
===========
Most things can be done through LastFmClient class(radio realted things, like handshake,
change staion, request a playlist, artist/album/track info(meta data)...) 
and TypeClasses.LastFmUser(user related things, like ban or love a track, add it
to the personal playlist,...)

Howto scrobble a track?
=======================
		'Create a scrobbler manager, it manages all scrobblers for the users
		Dim m As New Scrobbler.ScrobblerManager()
        Dim init As New Scrobbler.ScrobblerInit
        init.User = m_user

        'you may change this, of course^^
        'For clients who have no official client Id this MUST be left as is!
        'init.Version = My.Application.Info.Version.ToString(2)

		'handshake the scrobbler
        m.Handshake(init)

		'Some sample track
		Dim sampleTrack as TypeClasses.TrackInfo
		'set the time stamp(sample)
		sampleTrack.TimeStamp = 12345678
		'you can also use timeStampMe method(sets it to current unix time)
		sampleTrack.TimeStampMe()
		'Make sure you set the username!
		sampleTrack.Username = "SampleUser"
		
		'Now there are two ways to scrobble
		'==================================
		'1) Direct, catch the scrobble event of ScrobblerManager if you want...
		m.scrobble(sampleTrack)
		
		'2) Indirect(recommended), cache the track and then scrobble the cache
		'   (this is useful if scobbler is unreachable or there was an error;
		'   recommended way by scrobbler spec page)
		
		'The "SampleUser" can be left out and set later, it's for saving, loading
		'and identifying the cache
		Dim cache as New ScrobbleCache("SampleUser")
		'Append track to cache
		cache.append(sampleTrack)
		'set the savePath property and use True as param here to save to disk
		write()
		
		'scrobble the cache
		m.scrobble(cache)
